1. The decision rule for the classification is "If X1 <7.5 then A else B".The new value will be classified as A.
2. The size of the margin is 2 units.
3. Observation 6,7,8,9 and 10 receives a penalty. Observation 6,7,8,9 and 10 are the support vectors.
4. The total penalty is (0.5+0.5+3.5+2.5+4.5)/2 = 5.75 margin width. Here, 11.5 units is in the scale of x1 and margin width is 2.
5. Yes, if we increase our margin width by 0.05 units in terms of margin width (0.1 units in scale of x1),
   then we attain a margin width of 6. Hence we can a achieve a larger margin width. The main idea behind this is that we stil have 
   a bandwidth of increasing the width of 0.25 units. And we have 5 support vectors. So we can increase the penalty 
   by 0.25/5 per vector which is 0.05 units.
6. Yes, the data is seperable and 4, 8 and 9 will be support vectors.
