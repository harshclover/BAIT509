1. 
Pros for Candidate A/ Cons for Candidate B-
a) It can be seen that Candidate A is more stable as comapred to Candidate B.
b) He will be more consistent in his working capacity since he is less expected to deviate from his mean productivity of 75 becuase of 
lower variance

Pros for Candidate B/ Cons for Candidate A-
a) Candidate A is less robust to handle a higher workload> If occasionally a case come when he has to perform more than his daily tasks, 
he is more likely to fail.
b) The point above supports Candidate B's flexibility. He is more flexible for work where you have spontenous or unequal amounts of 
workloads on different days.

2.
Pros for Candidate B/ Cons for Candidate A-
In this case, it can be seen that even though Candidate B has more variance and has inconsistent productivity, his lowest productivity 
is still greater than the bestr Candidate A can offer.

Pros for Candidate A/ Cons for Candidate B-
Again, the only advantage of having Candidate B is that there is no necessity of having that high productivity, and consistency is 
preferred over productivity, and the spread of workload is even through the time frame or period of work.

The forecast is more biased as a result of which our predictions are skewed to a lower value than the actual values. This can be 
because we chose a window size greater than optimal, or number of neighbours to take into account greater than optimal in order 
to make prediction, i.e. underfitting of data leading to higher bias in predictions.
